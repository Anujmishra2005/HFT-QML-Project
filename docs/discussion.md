# Discussion

Discuss limitations:
- HFT requires very low latency and millisecond/sublime resolution â€” current pipeline uses minute-level or simulated data.
- Classical models are baseline proxies; QML prototypes are experimental.
- Future work: integrate RL, real-time data feeds, and optimize latency for deployment.
